This is the half life calculator.

** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DO THE PROBLEM, THEN TO USE THIS TO CHECK YOUR WORK ** 

Problems will always provide at least three out of the following four variables

- half life time (h)
- original mass (M0)
- ending mass (M) 
- time passed (t)
- number of half lives (n)**

**number of half lives does not count as one of the variables usually provided, as there is a calculation that can be done for it (below)

Equations:
  m_o = m * 2^n

  n = t/h

Your answer, along with all of the other data, will be printed out for display.
