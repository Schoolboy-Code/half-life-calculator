This is the half life calculator.


** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO DO THE PROBLEM, THEN TO USE THIS TO CHECK YOUR WORK ** 

** NOTE: THIS CALCULATOR WILL NOT WORK ON PROBLEMS WHERE N IS GIVEN, SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY CASES TO CONSIDER. THIS MAY CHANGE IN A LATER UPDATE. **


Run it on replit: https://replit.com/@blitcssh/half-life-calculator#main.py

This calculator works on problems which provide at least three out of the following four variables

- half life time (h)
- original mass (M0)
- ending mass (M) 
- time passed (t)
- number of half lives (n)**

**number of half lives does not count as one of the variables usually provided, as there is a calculation that can be done for it (below)

Equations:
  m_o = m * 2^n

  n = t/h

Your answer, along with all of the other data, will be printed out for display. 


Version v1.0.0
- Implemented a working prototype
- Does not currently work in programs where n is provided.
